# Quality Assessment Documentation

## Overview
This documentation provides a detailed overview of how to use the `QualityScorer` class from the `dataformer` library to evaluate the quality of responses generated by a language model (LLM). The `QualityScorer` class assesses responses based on predefined criteria and returns scores that reflect their quality.

## Initialization
Before using the `QualityScorer`, ensure that you have loaded the necessary environment variables and initialized the language model.

### Example Initialization
```python
from dataformer.components import QualityScorer
from dataformer.llms import AsyncLLM
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load environment variables from .env file
load_dotenv()

# Initialize the language model
llm = AsyncLLM(
    model="gpt-4o", api_provider="openai"
)

# Create an instance of the QualityScorer class
scorer = QualityScorer(llm=llm)
```

## Scoring Responses
The `QualityScorer` class can be used to score multiple responses based on a given instruction. The scoring process involves generating prompts using a template and parsing the scores returned by the language model.

### Example Input
```python
input = [{
    "instruction": "What are the key features of Python programming language?",
    "responses": [
        "Python is known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It supports multiple programming paradigms, has a rich standard library, and is widely used in various domains such as web development, data science, and automation.",
        "Python is a language. It is used for coding. Some people like it. It can do things. There are libraries. It is not the only language. Some say it's good, others not so much.",
        "Python is a popular programming language with easy syntax and extensive libraries. It is used for tasks like scripting, web development, and scientific computing. Its dynamic typing can be both a strength and a weakness depending on the context."
    ]
}]
```

### Scoring the Responses
```python
results = scorer.score(input, use_cache=False)  # By default, cache is True.
```

### Example Output
The results can be printed in a formatted manner to display the instruction, responses, and their corresponding scores.

```python
COLOR = {
    "RED": "\033[91m",
    "GREEN": "\033[92m",
    "YELLOW": "\033[93m",
    "BLUE": "\033[94m",
    "PURPLE": "\033[95m",
    "CYAN": "\033[96m",
    "WHITE": "\033[97m",
    "ENDC": "\033[0m",
}

for result in results:
    instruction = result['instruction']
    responses = result['responses']
    scores = result['scores']
    print(f"{COLOR['BLUE']}Instruction: {instruction}{COLOR['ENDC']}")
    for i in range(len(responses)):
        print(f"{COLOR['PURPLE']}Response{i+1}: {responses[i]}{COLOR['ENDC']}")
        print(f"{COLOR['GREEN']}Score{i+1}: {scores[i]}{COLOR['ENDC']}")
    print("\n")
```

### Example Output
```
Instruction: What are the key features of Python programming language?
Response1: Python is known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It supports multiple programming paradigms, has a rich standard library, and is widely used in various domains such as web development, data science, and automation.
Score1: 9.5

Response2: Python is a language. It is used for coding. Some people like it. It can do things. There are libraries. It is not the only language. Some say it's good, others not so much.
Score2: 4.0

Response3: Python is a popular programming language with easy syntax and extensive libraries. It is used for tasks like scripting, web development, and scientific computing. Its dynamic typing can be both a strength and a weakness depending on the context.
Score3: 8.0
```
