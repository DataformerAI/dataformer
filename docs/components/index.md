# Components Overview

Dataformer is comprised of several key components that enhance its overall functionality. Each component plays a distinct role in optimizing various aspects of the system. Below is an overview of these components, with links for further exploration:

- **[AsyncLLM](./async_llm.md)**: Enables asynchronous interactions with large language models, facilitating efficient processing of multiple concurrent requests.

- **[EvolInstruct](./evol_instruct.md)**: Utilizes reinforcement learning techniques to optimize model performance, specifically in generating high-quality instructional content.

- **[EvolQuality](./evol_quality.md)**: Focuses on improving response quality from language models by iteratively evolving and refining generated outputs.

- **[Complexity](./Complexity.md)**: Discusses the complexity metrics and their implications in the context of model performance and evaluation.

- **[Cot](./Cot.md)**: Explores the Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting technique to enhance reasoning capabilities in language models.

- **[Quality Score](./Quality_Score.md)**: Provides insights into the quality scoring mechanisms used to evaluate model outputs.

- **[Pvg](./Pvg.md)**: Details the Pvg component and its role in the Dataformer architecture.

- **[Magpie](./Magpie.md)**: Describes the Magpie component and its functionalities within the system.

- **[Rto](./Rto.md)**: Outlines the Rto component and its significance in the overall framework.
